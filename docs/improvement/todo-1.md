# Codebase Improvement Plan

This document outlines critical issues, potential bugs, and areas for improvement identified in the codebase.

## 1. Critical Issues

- [x] **`FieldRenderer` Props Conflict Risk**: Props from `meta` might conflict with standard HTML attributes.
- [x] **Unimplemented Array Field**: The `ArrayField` is not implemented, causing a gap in functionality.
- [x] **Type Safety with `Record<string, any>`**: Using `Record<string, any>` for props weakens type safety.
- [x] **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Error handling is inconsistent across components.

## 2. Potential Bugs

- [x] **Date Field Timezone Issues**: The date field may not handle timezones correctly.
- [ ] **Missing Form Validation in `EnumField`**: The `EnumField` lacks proper validation.
- [ ] **Lingering `console.log`**: Debugging `console.log` statements remain in the code.

## 3. Improvement Suggestions

- [ ] **Performance Optimization for `useSchemaForm`**: The `useSchemaForm` hook could be optimized for better performance.
- [ ] **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes and better label associations.
- [ ] **Code De-duplication**: Refactor to reduce code duplication between field components.
- [ ] **Meta Type Validation**: Implement validation for meta types to ensure correctness.
- [ ] **Internationalization (i18n) Support**: Add support for multiple languages.
